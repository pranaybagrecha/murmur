# Privacy Policy - Murmur

This Privacy Policy explains how Murmur ("Murmur", "we" or "us") collect, use and share your information when you use our website, mobile application and other online products and services (we call all these the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.

We collect minimal information that can be used to maintain the Services for the users, and to generate revenue for continued maintenance, development and operation of the Services. At any point of using our Services we don't require you to give us your real name or exact age. We don't automatically track your precise location unless you expressly consent to it for enabling some of our Services. You can update information as you see fit and ask us to delete your information.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page or by providing you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification wherever possible. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: murmuranon@gmail.com

## SECTION 1: HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

### A. Information Provide to Us by You

- **Account Information**: When you use the mobile application, a username will be randomly assigned to you that you may change at any time. Your username is publicly displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you post or send a direct message to another user. Please keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who see it may determine your identity. We may also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age or gender, that will be associated with your account. This information may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device ("personal information"). Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) Deidentified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act's scope, like: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994

- **Content Submitted**: We store the content you generate and submit while using the mobile application. This includes your posts, comments and your messages with other users. These may further include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos and other media.

- **Other**: We may receive other information from you generated while communication directly with us through channels including or other than the mobile application, such as our website, forms, promotions, advertisements, and third-party social media like Instagram and Facebook.

### B. Automatically collected Information

- **Your Interactions**: We store data on the actions you take when using the mobile application. This includes your interactions with posts, comments, chats and groups. Examples of such interactions include but are not limited to rating a chat, liking a post, reporting a post, favoriting a chat, blocking a chat, subscribing to a group, and group moderator status, if you have one.

- **Location data**: If you enable the location permissions when you use the mobile application, we will use your location to show content in the 'Nearby' section of the mobile application. The location will also be used for enabling other features of the mobile application. Further, the location could be used to show relevant advertising. In absence of location permissions, some of the location-dependent features of the mobile application may not work. However, for business purposes, such as showing advertisements, we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address. In such a case, your posts, comments, chat would not be associated with this derived, approximate location.

- **Other Usage data**: We collect and store some of the technical information pieces when you access and use our Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms.

## SECTION 13: ARBITRATION

Please read this section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate disputes with Murmur and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Murmur.

Except for any dispute in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, you and Murmur waive your respective rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential and binding arbitration held in-person at Mumbai, India (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the rules of JAMS, which are available on the [JAMS website](http://www.jamsadr.com/). You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and Murmur agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Murmur and that you and Murmur will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms and the JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. You and Murmur agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Murmur must be sent to murmuranon@gmail.com.

## SECTION 14: APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE

These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India without resort to its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the arbitration provision in Section 13 does not apply (if ever), you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the courts located in Mumbai, India and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.

## SECTION 15: TERMINATION

You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your User Account and discontinuing use of all the Services from Murmur. If you stop using the Services without deleting your User Account, Murmur reserves the right to deactivate your User Account due to prolonged inactivity.

Murmur reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services and to block or prevent future your future access to, and use of the Services for any or no reason including for violating these Terms or our Community Guidelines.

## SECTION 16: SEVERABILITY

If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## SECTION 17: MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, constitute the entire legally binding agreement between you and Murmur regarding your access to and use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms without Murmur's prior written consent. Murmur may, without restriction, assign any of our rights and obligations under these Terms, at its sole discretion, with 30 days' prior notice. Your right to terminate these Terms at any time pursuant to Section 15 remains unaffected.
