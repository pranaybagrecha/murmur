            <h2>Privacy Policy - Murmur</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Murmur ("Murmur", "we" or "us") collect, use and share your information when you use our website, mobile application and other online products and services (we call all these the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>
            <p>We collect minimal information that can be used to maintain the Services for the users, and to generate revenue for continued maintenance, development and operation of the Services. At any point of using our Services we don't require you to give us your real name or exact age. We don't automatically track your precise location unless you expressly consent to it for enabling some of our Services. You can update information as you see fit and ask us to delete your information.</p>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page or by providing you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification wherever possible. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:murmuranon@gmail.com" class="email-link">murmuranon@gmail.com</a></p>

            <h3>SECTION 1: HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h3>
            <h4>A. Information Provide to Us by You</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: When you use the mobile application, a username will be randomly assigned to you that you may change at any time. Your username is publicly displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you post or send a direct message to another user. Please keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who see it may determine your identity. We may also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age or gender, that will be associated with your account. This information may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device ("personal information"). Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) Deidentified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act's scope, like: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994</li>
                <li><strong>Content Submitted</strong>: We store the content you generate and submit while using the mobile application. This includes your posts, comments and your messages with other users. These may further include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos and other media.</li>
                <li><strong>Other</strong>: We may receive other information from you generated while communication directly with us through channels including or other than the mobile application, such as our website, forms, promotions, advertisements, and third-party social media like Instagram and Facebook.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>B. Automatically collected Information</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Interactions</strong>: We store data on the actions you take when using the mobile application. This includes your interactions with posts, comments, chats and groups. Examples of such interactions include but are not limited to rating a chat, liking a post, reporting a post, favoriting a chat, blocking a chat, subscribing to a group, and group moderator status, if you have one.</li>
                <li><strong>Location data</strong>: If you enable the location permissions when you use the mobile application, we will use your location to show content in the 'Nearby' section of the mobile application. The location will also be used for enabling other features of the mobile application. Further, the location could be used to show relevant advertising. In absence of location permissions, some of the location-dependent features of the mobile application may not work. However, for business purposes, such as showing advertisements, we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address. In such a case, your posts, comments, chat would not be associated with this derived, approximate location.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Usage data</strong>: We collect and store some of the technical information pieces when you access and use our Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SECTION 2: USER CONTENT</h3>
            <p>The Services allow you and other users to create, post, send and store content, including messages, text, photos, and other materials (we call these "User Content"). You agree not to post, store, create or otherwise publish or send through the Services any User Content that violates our Community Guidelines, which we may update from time to time. Murmur has the right to delete or remove any User Content that we, in our sole discretion, view as in violation of these Terms or our Community Guidelines or for any other reason.</p>
            <p>If you submit or post User Content to the Services, you grant Murmur a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display your User Content in any media (now known or later developed), including in connection with Murmur's marketing and promotional activities. You agree that this license includes the right for Murmur to make User Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication on the Services or on other media and services. You further grant Murmur the right to publicly display your username in connection with User Content.</p>
            <p>You understand that User Content may be displayed publicly. Murmur does not control, take responsibility for or assume liability for any User Content or any loss or damage related to User Content.</p>
            <p>You may only post User Content that:</p>

                <li>You have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms of Use.</li>
                <li>Submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate;</li>
                <li>Post advertisements or solicitations of business;</li>

Murmur reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice. Murmur will also terminate a User's access to it's Services, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had User Submissions removed from the Services more than twice. Murmur may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 4: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
            <p>All copyrights and trademarks which are not the property of Murmur, that are used or referred to on the Services are the property of their respective owners.</p>
            <p>The Murmur logos and any other product or service name or slogan contained in the Services are trademarks of Murmur and its suppliers or licensors.

            <h3>SECTION 7: COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS</h3>
            <p>Murmur respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify Murmur's Designated Agent.</p>
            <p><strong>E-Mail Address</strong>: <a href="mailto:murmuranon@gmail.com" class="email-link">murmuranon@gmail.com</a></p>
            <p>Please see <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512" target="_blank">17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3)</a> for the requirements of a proper notification. You should note that if you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by Murmur or the alleged infringer as the result of Murmur's relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 8: INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS</h3>
            <p>Murmur provides a platform for users to communicate and interact with one another. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users and Murmur has no responsibility or liability with respect to any online or offline interactions. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other users of our Services. Please use your best judgment and keep safety in mind when you use the Services and interact with other users.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 9: INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Murmur, its independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, "Murmur Parties"), from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your use of the Services;</li>
                <li>Any User Content, User Submissions or Other Submissions you provide;</li>
                <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
                <li>Your violation of any rights of another; or your conduct in connection with the Services.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>SECTION 10: DISCLAIMERS</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the services and service materials are provided on an "as is" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, except as expressly provided to the contrary in a writing by Murmur. Murmur disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement as to the services and service materials. Murmur does not represent or warrant that the services or service materials are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. Murmur is not responsible for typographical errors or omissions relating to pricing, text or photography. While Murmur attempts to make your access to and use of the services safe, Murmur cannot and does not represent or warrant that the services or its servers are free of viruses or other harmful components; therefore, you should use industry-recognized software to detect and disinfect viruses from any download.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 11: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>You assume all risk arising from your use of the Services, including but not limited to all of the risks associated with any online or offline interactions with other users. You agree to take any and all necessary precautions when interacting with other users.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Murmur or the Murmur Parties be liable for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or any other damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss of use, loss of profits or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort (including but not limited to negligence) or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with the use of or inability to use the services or the service materials, including without limitation any damages caused by or resulting from reliance on any information obtained through the services or that result from the online or offline conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the services (including without limitation bodily injury, death or property damage), mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or user content, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from acts of god, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to Murmur's records, programs or services. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the aggregate liability of Murmur or the Murmur Parties, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), product liability, strict liability or other theory, arising out of or relating to the use of or inability to use the services or to these terms exceed any compensation you pay, if any, to Murmur for access to or use of the services, or, if you have not paid expertise for the use of any services, the amount of $25.00.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this section may not apply to you depending on your country of residence.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 12: MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICES</h3>
            <p>Murmur reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, or any features or portions of the Services, without prior notice. You agree that Murmur will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services, or any part of the Services.</p>

            <h3>SECTION 13: ARBITRATION</h3>
            <p>Please read this section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate disputes with Murmur and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Murmur.</p>
            <p>Except for any dispute in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, you and Murmur waive your respective rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential and binding arbitration held in-person at Mumbai, India (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the rules of JAMS, which are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">JAMS website</a>. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
